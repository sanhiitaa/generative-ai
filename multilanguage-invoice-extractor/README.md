# Multi-Language Invoice Extractor

Welcome to the [Multi-Language Invoice Extractor project](https://generative-ai-multilanguage-invoice-extractor.streamlit.app/)! 
This application was built as part of the ["Building Gen AI App 12+ Hands-on Projects with Gemini Pro"](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-gen-ai-app-end-to-end-projects-with-gemini-pro/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) course by Krish Naik. 
The project showcases how to integrate the Gemini-Pro-Vision model with Streamlit to extract and analyze invoice data in multiple languages.

## Key tasks performed: 

**Loading Environment Variables**: Utilized dotenv to securely load API keys.

**Importing Necessary Libraries**: Imported essential libraries including streamlit, google.generativeai, os, and PIL.

**Configuring the Gemini API**: Loaded the API key and configured the Gemini model for use.

**Loading an Instance of the Gemini Model**: Initialized the Gemini model to process invoice data.

**Generating a Response from the Model**: Created a function to generate responses by providing an image, a prompt, and an input question.

**Handling Image Uploads**: Implemented functionality to process uploaded invoice images.

**Building the Streamlit App**: Initialized and configured the Streamlit app for deployment.

**Uploading and Displaying the Invoice Image**: Enabled users to upload and display invoice images within the app.

**Accepting User Input**: Added an input field for users to ask questions about the invoice.
